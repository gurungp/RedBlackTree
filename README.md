Practice with Data Structures and Algorithms. Implementing RedBlack Tree (Self balancing binary tree)

In this implementation, I don't use NIL nodes but handle the nullptr children as Black Nodes and don't need to handle
double black nodes as done in some of the implementions I found on the internet and other tutorials.
